## Course Project

By Sept 15th, please email me (krmschmitz@gmail.com) the following information about your project:

1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
2. What is the idea for your project?
3. What information will your solution store?
4. What use cases/features/flows will your solution provide?

For example:

1. "The problem that I am trying to solve is that sometimes there are people that would like to bring in additional income for their family. They do a lot of baking, and they would like to be able to easily sell their baking to other people."
2. "My idea is an online store, where users will be able to list their baked goods for sale for other users to buy. Users will be able to list as many items as they like, and other users can browse those items to buy them."
3. "The information my website will store is the list of users that have registered, and the items that they have made available for sale. The items will each have a picture, a name, a price, and a desciption. Users will have a name and a password."
4. "My website will have the following features:"
  * "Users can log in to the website with their username and password, to gain access"
  * "Users can add new items for sale, with the name, picture, price and description"
  * "Users can edit their existing items and change the name, picture, price, and description"
  * "Users can remove their items if they no longer sell them"
  * "Users can view all of the items that they have for sale"
  * "Guests to the website can browse all of the items that all of the users have for sale"
  * "Guests can contact the seller if they would like to buy one of the items that is for sale"
